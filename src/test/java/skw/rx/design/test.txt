Can you treat it like an oil well
When it's underground, out of sight?
And if the sight is just a whore sign
Will it make enough sense to me?

Pretend the table is a trust knot
We'll put our labels down, favors down
I'll watch some yards of twine unravel
And you'll never get it back

It's what I want, it's what I want
(It's what I want, twine comes down)
It's what I want, it's what I want
(It's what I want )

Don't you know, I could make you try
Make you try, make you try, make you try

Well, I've been down, the king of it
It is all I have, I've been down
And I could wait to hear the words
They're diamond sharp today

It's what I want, it's what I want
(It's what I want, twine comes down)
It's what I want, it's what I want
(It's what I want )

Don't you know, I could make you try
Make you try, make you try, make you try

Well, I've been down, well, I've been down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
